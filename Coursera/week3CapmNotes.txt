Rf + Beta(E(Rm) - Rf)

If beta is negative 

and return on market portfolio > Risk free return then the equation for CAPM results in a negative value

but if return on market portfolio < Risk free return then the equation for CAPM results in a positive value

so for negative beta:
low value of market portfolio results in postive CAPM
High value of market portfolio results in negative CAPM
And cov(returns from market portfolio, return from target equity) is -ve and so they move in opposite directions
