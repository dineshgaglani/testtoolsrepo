/*
Search for a Peak: A peak element in array A is an A[i] where its adjacent elements are less than A[i]. So, A[i - 1] < A[i] and A[i + 1] < A[i].

Assume there are no duplicates. Also, assume that A[-1] and A[length] are negative infinity (-âˆž). So A[0] can be a peak if A[1] < A[0].

A = [1,3,4,5,2] => Peak = 5
A = [5,3,1] => Peak = 5
A = [1,3,5] => Peak = 5
