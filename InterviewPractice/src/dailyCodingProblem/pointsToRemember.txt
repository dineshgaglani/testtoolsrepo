Data structures:

Heaps: Heaps have to add the new element to the end of the heap, so the array in which the heap will be stored in will be bigger than the heap size,
the heap size is tracked by size variable and not array length.

Max/Min Queues: Max/Min queues are easiest implemented as arrays, and using circular array method

Circular array: To distinguish between array full and array empty a size variable is needed. Subtracting tail - head will either leave an empty spot or
will fail at first insertion

Always always always check for repeating substring on string based questions (a string that partially starts with some other following string , example: a, an, another)

To speed up 2dimensional grid navigation, create a co-ord object and for neighbors return the list of coords and while checking, iterate the list of neighbor
coords and catch ArrayIndexOutOfBounds, continue on the catch block. This will save a tonne of time

Delete the element that will cause an infinite recursion before the "explore" stage itself
