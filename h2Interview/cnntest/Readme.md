Tests are driven by cucumber feature files 

`src/test/resources/cnntest/*.feature`

The feature files are translated to java code in the class

`cnntest.Stepdefs`

The class defers the selenium activity to corresponding page objects located at package:

`pages`

The Page object Web Element member variables are not initialized in the class directly, they are initialized using reflection

`common.PageInitializer`

The actual locators are present in 

`src/test/resources/locators`

This way helps when there are multiple environments with different locators but same test cases (such as iphone app and web app)

The property files in the locators folder can be generated by running

`propertiesbuilder.ModuleDriver`

The API tests are being run using RestAssured framework and the classes are present inside

`api`

package

**BuildNotes**:

To run the test, execute:

`docker-compose up`

from one folder above the readme file

**Additional notes**
